Copenhagen, October '95

This is the result of our attempt to write a freeware sequel to Civilization. 

Unfortunately, we do not have the time to continue its development, so if
you would like to give it a try, look for a file called "AQDEV027.ZIP". It
contains the source for this program.

PS: If the game doesn't seem to work properly, try extracting it like this:

PKUNZIP -d ANTIQ027.ZIP
