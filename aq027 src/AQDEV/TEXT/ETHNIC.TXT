Example:

Babylon
-------

30,000 Egyptians
70,000 Babylonians

Has Temple Complex

Conquered by the Egyptians
who have 1 Mounted Flint Sword unit holding it.

DISTRIBUTION:

Egyptians	30pts +  50pts	=  80pts =	36%
Babylonians	70pts x2	= 140pts =	64%

Resulting in Ethnic Unrest:

The odds are in the Babylonians favour - 64 vs 36. The outcome is in
favour of the Egyptians though:

10,000 Babylonians are massacred
10,000 Babylonians become refugees
10,000 Babylonians become partisans

Babylon
-------

30,000 Egyptians
40,000 Babylonians

Conquered by the Egyptians
who have 1 Mounted Flint Sword unit holding it.

DISTRIBUTION

Egyptians	43pts +  50pts	=  93pts =	45%
Babylonians	57pts x2	= 114pts =	55%

Resulting in yet another turn of Ethnic Unrest:

The odds are still in the Babylonians favour -
but the outcome is not.

10,000 Babylonians are massacred
10,000 Babylonians become refugees
10,000 Babylonians become partisans
